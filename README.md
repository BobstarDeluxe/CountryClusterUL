# Unsupervised Learning: Clustering Countries Based on Demographic Data  
CSCA 5622 Unsupervised Learning Project

## Overview  
This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to cluster countries based on their socio-economic and demographic data. 

Using various clustering algorithms, the project aims to uncover meaningful groupings of countries that share similar characteristics. 

The analysis leverages features like GDP, life expectancy, child mortality and other indicators to determine clusters, which could provide insights for policymakers and researchers in identifying regional trends and groupings.

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project includes global country-level data with various socio-economic and demographic indicators, including measures like GDP, life expectancy, fertility rate, and others. The dataset consists of multiple countries and their corresponding values across these indicators.

## Project Highlights  
- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships and patterns in demographic and socio-economic features.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Transformation and normalization of the data to prepare it for clustering.  
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Implementation of K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN and GMM to identify meaningful country groupings.
